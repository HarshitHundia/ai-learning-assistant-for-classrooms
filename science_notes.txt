The Solar System consists of the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity, including the eight planets, dwarf planets, dozens of moons, and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The four inner, terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. The two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, composed mostly of substances with relatively low melting points (such as water, ammonia, and methane). The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with Jupiter containing most of the remaining mass.
